 ## Installation Instructions:
 This application is basically plug and play.  Pop it and the included files with it in a directory, and change the  "password:" and "database:" keys in the connection variable in the prompt.js to reflect your username and the company's database.

 ## Usage Instructions:
 Follow the onscreen instructions, and you'll be able to create a database in no time! The CLI includes directions for each prompt, so, for example, if you want to add a new employee to the database, you'll simply navigate to the "add an employee, role, or department" input, select "add a new employee" and follow the instructions to add a new employee!
